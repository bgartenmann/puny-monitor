A batteries-included monitoring tool for single hosts.

- Just enough monitoring to be useful üîç
- Install in 30 seconds üèéÔ∏è
- Perfect for Kamal and other containerized setups üêã

## Why Puny Monitor? 

Puny Monitor aims to be a dead-simple, no-frills monitoring solution for single hosts. It provides enough information to be useful (and not a bit more) and avoids the complications and overhead that come with existing solutions. 

To put it simply, Puny Monitor replicates [Digital Ocean's Monitoring](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/monitoring) but runs on any ol' VPS or metal server you might have lying around. It is the perfect solution for IndieHackers who use Rails & Kamal, but works beautifully for anyone that wants some useful monitoring quickly. 

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
